# Usage

After installing the extension, when you start Textractor and have selected a
text thread, Textractor will automatically start the server at
`ws://localhost:6677`

You will need a WebSocket client such as
[texthooker-ui](https://github.com/Renji-XD/texthooker-ui)
to stream the text and display it to your browser
