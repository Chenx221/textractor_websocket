# Introduction

An extension for [Textractor](https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor) written in
Rust that opens a WebSocket locally on port `6677` and sends the text from
Textractor to all the connected clients.

A WebSocket client such as
[texthooker-ui](https://github.com/Renji-XD/texthooker-ui)
can stream the text by the server and display it to your browser.

The source code is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/kuroahna/textractor_websocket)
